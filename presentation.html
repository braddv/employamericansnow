					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<br>
					<p>the USA's stated economic goals:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>full employment</li>
					<li>price stability</li>
					</ul>
					<p><small>these are put out in both the Federal Reserve Act 1977 amendment and the Employment Act of 1976</small></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>which levers can we pull?</h3>
						<br>
						<ul><li>monetary policy</li>
							<ul><li>Federal Reserve, largely "trained" economists</li></ul>
							<li>fiscal policy</li>
							<ul><li>Congress, largely politicians bought with money</li></ul>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>critique of "independent" economic "science"</h3>
						<br>
						<p><small>"In the United States the revival of belief in the potency of monetary policy was strengthened also by increasing disillusionment with fiscal policy, not so much with its potential to affect aggregate demand as with the practical and political feasibility of so using it" - Friedman</small></p>
						<p>monetary policy had become "perfected" by the Taylor Rule</p>
						<p><small>yet, we still do not have full employment</small></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>what to do?</h3>
						<br>
						<p>get back to our roots as political economists</p>
						<p>subvert models & bring back morals</p>
						<br>
						<small>"The transition from a paradigm in crisis to a new one from which a new tradition of normal science can emerge is far from a cumulative process, one achieved by an articulation or extension of the old paradigm. Rather it is a reconstruction of the field from new fundamentals, a reconstruction that changes some of the field's most elementary theoretical generalizations as well as many of its paradigm methods and applications. During the transition period there will be a large but never complete overlap between the problems that can be solved by the old and by the new paradigm. But there will also be a decisive difference in the modes of solution. When the transition is complete, the profession will have changed its view of the field, its methods, and its goals." - Kuhn</small>

						<h2>The Seed of a Job Guarantee</h2>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>If implemented, it becomes a channel for direct government job creation. The bill establishes a fund, initially endowed with $5.5 billion dollars, to directly employ low income youth.</p>

					<p>Money is provided through two different channels:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>$1.5 billion in competitive grants for work based training and education</li>
							<li>$4 billion for summer and year round employment opportunities</li>
							<ul><small>
								<li>$1 billion divided equally between States</li>
								<li>$1 billion distributed on the basis of the relative number of 16-25 year old individuals in the civilian labor force, compared to the total number in all States.</li>
								<li>$1 billion distributed on the basis of the relative number of unemployed individuals in each State, compared to the total number in all States</li>
								<li>$1 billion on the basis of the relative number of disadvantaged young adults and youth in each State, compared to the total number in all States.</li>

<p>In this paper, we study one of the key life cycle labor market facts: that unemployment
declines as a function of age. We propose a simple model of occupational learning that
accounts for this fact. Young workers, who are less likely to have found their “true calling,”
are more likely to separate from employment matches. Hence, our model correctly predicts
that age differences in unemployment rates are due to age differences in separation rates.
Our calibrated model does a very good job at quantitatively replicating the age differences
in unemployment and separation rates observed in the U.S. data. Moreover, labor force
aging in our model accounts for a significant fraction of the fall in aggregate unemployment
observed in the past 35 years.</p>
