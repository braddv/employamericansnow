					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<br>
					<p>the USA's stated economic goals:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>full employment</li>
					<li>price stability</li>
					</ul>
					<p><small>1977 Amendment to the Federal Reserve Act and the Employment Act of 1976</small></p>
					<aside class="notes">The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
and the Federal Open Market Committee shall maintain long run
growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with
the economy's long run potential to increase production, so as to promote
effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and
moderate long-term interest rates. The Board of Governors shall consult
with Congress at semiannual hearings before the Committee on
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee
on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives
about the Board of Governors' and the Federal Open
Market Committee's objectives and plans with respect to the ranges
of growth or diminution of monetary and credit aggregates for the
upcoming twelve months, taking account of past and prospective developments
in production, employment, and prices. Nothing in this Act
shall be interpreted to require that such ranges of growth or diminution
be achieved if the Board of Governors and the Federal Open
Market Committee determine that they cannot or should not be
achieved because of changing conditions.". <br> ----- <br>
The Act explicitly instructs the nation to strive toward four ultimate goals: full employment, growth in production, price stability, and balance of trade and budget. <br>The Act set specific numerical goals for the President to attain. By 1983, unemployment rates should be not more than 3% for persons aged 20 or over and not more than 4% for persons aged 16 or over, and inflation rates should not be over 4%. By 1988, inflation rates should be 0%. The Act allows Congress to revise these goals over time.<br>

If private enterprise appears not to be meeting these goals, the Act expressly allows the government to create a "reservoir of public employment." These jobs are required to be in the lower ranges of skill and pay to minimize competition with the private sector.<br>

The Act directly prohibits discrimination on account of gender, religion, race, age, and national origin in any program created under the Act.

						<h3>critique of "independent" economic "science"</h3>
						<p><small>"In the United States the revival of belief in the potency of monetary policy was strengthened also by increasing disillusionment with fiscal policy, not so much with its potential to affect aggregate demand as with the practical and political feasibility of so using it" - Milton Friedman</small></p>
						<br>
						<p>monetary policy had become "perfected" by the Taylor Rule in the Great Moderation</p>
						<p><small>yet, we still do not have full employment</small></p>

					<section>
						<h3>what to do?</h3>
						<br>
						<p>get back to our roots as political economists</p>
						<p>subvert models, bring back ethics and morality</p>
						<br>
						<small>"The transition from a paradigm in crisis to a new one from which a new tradition of normal science can emerge is far from a cumulative process, one achieved by an articulation or extension of the old paradigm. Rather it is a reconstruction of the field from new fundamentals, a reconstruction that changes some of the field's most elementary theoretical generalizations as well as many of its paradigm methods and applications. During the transition period there will be a large but never complete overlap between the problems that can be solved by the old and by the new paradigm. But there will also be a decisive difference in the modes of solution. When the transition is complete, the profession will have changed its view of the field, its methods, and its goals." - Thomas Kuhn</small><br><br>

							"They must reach a high standard in several different directions and must combine talents not often found together. They must be mathematician, historian, statesman, philosopher—in some degree. They must understand symbols and speak in words. They must contemplate the particular in terms of the general, and touch abstract and concrete in the same flight of thought. They must study the present in the light of the past for the purposes of the future. No part of human's nature or their institutions must lie entirely outside their regard. They must be purposeful and disinterested in a simultaneous mood; as aloof and incorruptible as an artist, yet sometimes as near the earth as a politician."

						‘I’ve come to the position that there should be a stronger bias against the use of math,’ Romer explained to me. ‘If somebody came and said: “Look, I have this Earth-changing insight about economics, but the only way I can express it is by making use of the quirks of the Latin language”, we’d say go to hell, unless they could convince us it was really essential. The burden of proof is on them.’</aside>

						<p>The Profit Equation:</p>
						<p><small>profit in the system is equal to the sum of investment, consumption, the government deficit, and net exports, then subtracting out wages</small></p>
						<p>Political Aspects of Full Employment</p>
						<p><small>“a solid majority of economists is now of the opinion that, even in a capitalist system, full employment may be secured by a government spending programme, provided there is in existence adequate plan to employ all existing labour power, and provided adequate supplies of necessary foreign raw-materials may be obtained in exchange for exports”</small></p>

							<br>
							<br>political business cycle, people buy more politicians when profits are high <br>
							<br>
							When policy is influenced by politics, as it must be in a democracy, its content
and effects will not correspond to those that would result from a disinterested application
of Keynesian policy prescriptions. James Buchanan and Richard Wagner (1977)
argue forcefully that the political pressures placed on legislators and presidents yield an
asymmetry in the implementation of fiscal policy: the government creates stimulative
budget deficits not only in recessions, as the wise and benevolent policy maker would
surely and rightly do, but also in times of prosperity. Spending increases and tax cuts
yield votes regardless of the economic setting, resulting in continual deficits, an expanding
public sector, and inflation.
 In essence, political pressures preclude the possibility
of countercyclical fiscal policy.</aside>

						<p><small>deemed impossible by former CEA economists</small></p>
						<aside class="notes">We are former Chairs of the Council of Economic Advisers for Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. For many years, we have worked to make the Democratic Party the party of evidence-based economic policy. When Republicans have proposed large tax cuts for the wealthy and asserted that those tax cuts would pay for themselves, for example, we have shown that the economic facts do not support these fantastical claims. We have applied the same rigor to proposals by Democrats, and worked to ensure that forecasts of the effects of proposed economic policies, from investment in infrastructure, to education and training, to health care reforms, are grounded in economic evidence.  Largely as a result of efforts like these, the Democratic party has rightfully earned a reputation for responsibly estimating the effects of economic policies.

We are concerned to see the Sanders campaign citing extreme claims by Gerald Friedman about the effect of Senator Sanders’s economic plan—claims that cannot be supported by the economic evidence. Friedman asserts that your plan will have huge beneficial impacts on growth rates, income and employment that exceed even the most grandiose predictions by Republicans about the impact of their tax cut proposals.

As much as we wish it were so, no credible economic research supports economic impacts of these magnitudes. Making such promises runs against our party’s best traditions of evidence-based policy making and undermines our reputation as the party of responsible arithmetic. These claims undermine the credibility of the progressive economic agenda and make it that much more difficult to challenge the unrealistic claims made by Republican candidates.</aside>

<p>In this paper, we study one of the key life cycle labor market facts: that unemployment
declines as a function of age. We propose a simple model of occupational learning that
accounts for this fact. Young workers, who are less likely to have found their “true calling,”
are more likely to separate from employment matches. Hence, our model correctly predicts
that age differences in unemployment rates are due to age differences in separation rates.
Our calibrated model does a very good job at quantitatively replicating the age differences
in unemployment and separation rates observed in the U.S. data. Moreover, labor force
aging in our model accounts for a significant fraction of the fall in aggregate unemployment
observed in the past 35 years.</p>
